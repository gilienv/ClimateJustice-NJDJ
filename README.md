# National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) Scrapper

## Description

## Description

This Python script is designed to extract case details from the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) web app using Selenium WebDriver and save them to a CSV file. The script navigates through the website with respect to state names, clicks on total cases, then proceeds and solves 2 CAPTCHAs internally. After solving them, it extracts case details and saves them to a CSV file. This logic runs in a loop until data from the specified states is extracted.
